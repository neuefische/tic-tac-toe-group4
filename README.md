# Coding Challenge - Tic-Tac-Toe

Today we're going to test and improve our coding skills by creating a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python.  
This is not an easy task, but the goal is to solve it by writing good Pseudocode, splitting the problem into smaller chunks and having the concept of MVP in mind!      
Focus on having fun and trying things out. Don't worry how your result compares to others!

To get started first do the following:
### Set up your Repository
Fork and clone that repo to your local machine.  

### Now Work on Assignment
Read through the [assignment file](Tic-Tac-Toe-assignment.md) and follow the steps described there.

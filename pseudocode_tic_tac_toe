def check_winner(): 
	check for winner either X or O
	check for draw
	else return FALSE (i.e. gave goes on)
	returns {X, O, False}

def update_board(cell, player):
	decode user’s input (in the format ‘A1’) for example A1 is board[0]  = ‘X’ or ‘O’
	put the ‘player’ into the ‘cell’

def print_board():
	transform the ‘board’ into a 3 by 3 matrix 
	print it out into the console


INITIALIZE board = [‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’]

INITIALIZE player = “X”

print_board()	

WHILE TRUE

	PRINT player
	
	INPUT cell 

	result = update_board(cell)

	print_board()
	
	winner = check_winner()

	IF winner
		PRINT winner
		END 

	IF winner = ‘draw’
		PRINT ‘draw’
		END

	SWITCH player

Further explanation:

INITIALIZE board = [‘X’’, ‘  ’, ‘  ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’]
INITIALIZE board = [‘A1 ’, ‘A2 ’, ‘A3 ’, ‘B1 ’, ‘B2 ’, ‘B3 ’, ‘C1 ’, ‘C2 ’, ‘C3 ’]

print_board()

A1 A2 A3
B1 B2 B3
C1 C2 C3

PRINT player  “ Player X’s make your move! ”

INPUT cell like A1

Further implementations: 

Returns TRUE if update successful, otherwise FALSE

IF result = FALSE
	PRINT message
